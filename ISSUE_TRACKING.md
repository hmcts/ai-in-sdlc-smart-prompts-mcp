# 📊 Issue #2 Tracking - Enhancement Proposal

**Issue URL**: https://github.com/tanker327/prompts-mcp-server/issues/2
**Created**: June 2025
**Status**: ⏳ Awaiting maintainer response

## 🎯 While We Wait

Let's prepare the first PR so we're ready when the maintainer responds positively!

## 📋 First PR Preparation: Enhanced Tool Descriptions

This will be our smallest, most valuable change to start with.

### Files to Prepare:

1. **Enhanced tool descriptions** (from our enhancedTools.ts)
2. **Basic help functionality**
3. **Improved error messages**
4. **Tests for the changes**

### Strategy:
- Keep it small and focused
- No breaking changes
- Clear value proposition
- Easy to review and merge

## 🔄 Possible Maintainer Responses:

### ✅ Positive Response:
- "Love it! Please submit PRs"
- "Great ideas, let's start with X"
- "Interested, can you show me more?"

**Our Action**: Submit prepared PR immediately

### 🤔 Questions:
- "How does X work?"
- "What about Y consideration?"
- "Can you explain Z?"

**Our Action**: Answer thoroughly, provide examples

### 🔄 Modifications:
- "I like A but not B"
- "Can we do X differently?"
- "What if we approach Y this way?"

**Our Action**: Adapt our approach, be flexible

### ⏳ Delayed Response:
- No response for several days

**Our Action**: Be patient, prepare PRs anyway

### ❌ Negative Response:
- "Thanks, but not interested"
- "Prefer to keep it simple"

**Our Action**: Maintain our fork as separate project
