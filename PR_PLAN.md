Title: Enhancement Proposal: GitHub Integration and Advanced Features

Hi @tanker327! 

I've been using prompts-mcp-server and built some enhancements that might be valuable to the community. I'd love to contribute them back if you're interested.

Key enhancements include:
- GitHub integration for fetching prompts from repositories
- Enhanced AI guidance with workflow recommendations
- Advanced search with category/tag filtering
- Prompt composition capabilities
- Improved error handling with suggestions

These are backwards compatible and include comprehensive tests. Would you be interested in these features? I'm happy to submit them as separate PRs for easier review.

You can see the implementation at: https://github.com/jezweb/smart-prompts-mcp
```

### **Phase 2: Separate Feature PRs**
Based on maintainer feedback, create focused PRs:

#### **PR 1: Enhanced Tool Descriptions & Help System**
- Improved tool descriptions with examples
- Help system implementation
- Better error messages
- Small, easy to review

#### **PR 2: GitHub Integration (Core)**
- Basic GitHub fetching capability
- Configuration for GitHub repos
- Backwards compatible with local storage
- Comprehensive tests

#### **PR 3: Advanced Search Features**
- Category and tag filtering
- Search improvements
- Similar prompt suggestions
- Usage tracking

#### **PR 4: Prompt Composition**
- Combine prompts feature
- Template variable support
- Dynamic composition

### **Phase 3: Documentation**
- Update README with new features
- Add examples for GitHub integration
- Document configuration options
- Add migration guide

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations

### **Backwards Compatibility**
- Keep local file storage as default
- GitHub integration as opt-in feature
- No breaking changes to existing API

### **Code Style**
- Match existing TypeScript patterns
- Follow current test structure
- Maintain modular architecture

### **Testing**
- Add tests for all new features
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Include integration tests

## 📊 PR Checklist

For each PR:
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] TypeScript builds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Backwards compatible
- [ ] Follows existing code style
- [ ] Includes examples

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Create Issue**: Open discussion with maintainer
2. **Prepare Branches**: Create feature branches for each PR
3. **Start Small**: Begin with tool descriptions PR
4. **Iterate**: Respond to feedback and adjust

## 💡 Alternative Approach

If the maintainer prefers, we could:
- Maintain our fork as a "GitHub-enhanced" version
- Document it as an alternative implementation
- Keep both projects with clear differentiation
- Cross-reference in documentation

## 🤝 Benefits to Community

- **More Storage Options**: Local files OR GitHub repos
- **Better AI Experience**: Clear guidance reduces confusion
- **Advanced Features**: Search, compose, track usage
- **Enterprise Ready**: Private repo support
- **Active Development**: Two maintainers instead of one
